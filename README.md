This project is my portfolio which contains my works thus far, information about myself as a developer, and links to my github and LinkedIn accounts, as well as contact links and a link to my resume.

The portfolio page contains my current projects with screenshots of the page, title, brief description, repo link, and the project's deployed link. This portfolio is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue creating new programming projects. 

I built this project using html in combination with bootstrap - with color schemes from Bootswatch and icons from Font Awesome. I added an external stylesheet as well to override some Bootstrap presets to enhance the style of the page.
