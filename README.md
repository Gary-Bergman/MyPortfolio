# MyPortfolio
This project is my portfolio which contains my works thus far, information about myself as a developer, and links to my github and LinkedIn accounts.

This portfolio is a work in progress and will be updated as I continue through my coding bootcamp. The images are currently filler pics which will eventually include links to comppleted projects. 

I built this project using html in combination with bootstrap - with color schemes from bootswatch. I added an external styelsheet as well to override some bootstrap presets to enhance the style of the page.
